# Installation

To install for Adobe Fireworks CS6 on Mac OS X:  
`git clone https://github.com/iliaskarim/iOS-fireworks-ext.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/Fireworks\ CS6/Commands/iOS`

On other platforms or versions of Fireworks, clone or move these scripts into a new directory in Adobe Fireworks' commands directory. The name of the commands subdirectory that you create will be the name that appears in Fireworks' commands drop-down menu.

# Usage

1. Select the "master" page (in the pages panel, usually grouped with the layers panel) which for the icon is 1024x1024 and run the script, or for retina graphics select the @2x version
2. Run the appropriate script from Commands > iOS, which will delete all other pages, recreate and resize them, then open the export dialog for you
3. Select "Export all pages"
4. Export! The files will be named appropriately
